- **2 Agents Already Deployed**: GitHub, JIRA
- **5 Total Agents**: All with unified dual-mode communication
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All integration tests passing
- **3 Docker Images Built**: Ready for deployment

### ✅ Dual-Mode Communication
- **CLIENT Mode**: Human-friendly streaming text with emoji progress markers
- **AGENT Mode**: Structured JSON for efficient agent-to-agent communication
- **30-40% Token Savings**: Through A2A structured responses
- **Automatic Mode Detection**: Seamless switching based on caller type

### ✅ Orchestration Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Coordinate complex multi-step operations
- **5 Workflow Types**: Dependency checks, feature planning, GitHub ops, JIRA ops, code execution
- **Intelligent Routing**: Keyword-based task analysis and delegation
- **A2A Marker Injection**: Automatic triggering of agent mode in specialized agents

## 🔄 Example Workflow: Dependency Check

**User**: "Check dependencies for /Users/mingfang/Code/grab-youtube"

**Orchestrator Execution**:
1. **GitHub Agent** → Create tracking issue
2. **Coding Agent** → Run npm audit (finds 5 vulnerabilities)
3. **Coding Agent** → Fix attempts (fixes 3 of 5)
4. **JIRA Agent** → Update sprint with results

**User Receives**:
```
🔍 Detected dependency management task
📁 Project path: /Users/mingfang/Code/grab-youtube

📝 Step 1: Creating GitHub issue...
✅ GitHub issue created

🔍 Step 2: Running dependency audit...
✅ Audit completed - found 5 vulnerabilities

🔧 Step 3: Attempting to fix vulnerabilities...
✅ Fix attempt completed - fixed 3 of 5

📋 Step 4: Updating Jira...
✅ Jira updated
