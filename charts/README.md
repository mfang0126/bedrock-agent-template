- Command execution with timeout controls
- Multi-framework test runner
- Workspace management
- MCP client integration
- Security features (sanitization, sandboxing, validation)

**Use Case:** Understanding code execution and testing capabilities

---

### 8. Usage Scenarios (`08-usage-scenarios.mmd`)
**Purpose:** Common use cases and workflows

**Shows:**
- 5 typical scenarios:
  1. Security Audit
  2. Feature Development
  3. Bug Fix
  4. Code Review
  5. Sprint Planning
- Agent combinations for each scenario
- Step-by-step flows

**Use Case:** Understanding practical applications and which agents work together

---

### 9. System Architecture (`09-system-architecture.mmd`)
**Purpose:** Technical architecture and communication patterns

**Shows:**
- Task analysis engine and routing
- Inter-agent communication (subprocess calls)
- Security layer (validation, auth, rate limiting)
- Configuration management
- API integrations

**Use Case:** Understanding system design and technical implementation

---

## Agent Capabilities Summary

| Agent | Primary Purpose | Key Tools | External Dependencies |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinate agents, route tasks | Task analysis, workflow execution | All other agents |
| **Planning** | Task breakdown, planning | breakdown_task | None |
| **GitHub** | Repository & issue management | Issue/PR/repo operations | GitHub API |
| **Jira** | Project tracking | Ticket fetch/update, sprint management | Jira API |
| **Coding** | Code execution & testing | File ops, command exec, test runner | Local system |

## Key Workflows

1. **Security Audit Flow:** User â†’ Orchestrator â†’ Coding (audit) â†’ GitHub (issue) â†’ Jira (update)

2. **Feature Development:** User â†’ Orchestrator â†’ Planning (breakdown) â†’ GitHub (issues) â†’ Coding (implement) â†’ Coding (test) â†’ GitHub (PR) â†’ Jira (done)

3. **Bug Fix:** User â†’ Orchestrator â†’ GitHub (fetch) â†’ Coding (fix + test) â†’ GitHub (update/PR)

## Color Coding

- ðŸŒ¸ **Pink (#ffb6c1):** Orchestrator Agent
- ðŸŒŠ **Turquoise (#98d8c8):** Planning Agent  
- ðŸ’  **Sky Blue (#87ceeb):** GitHub Agent
- ðŸ”® **Plum (#dda0dd):** Jira Agent
- ðŸ§¡ **Sandy Brown (#f4a460):** Coding Agent
- ðŸ”¥ **Light Coral (#ffa07a):** Complex/Sequential Workflows

## Notes

- All agents communicate through the Orchestrator via subprocess calls
- Agents are stateless - each invocation is independent
- Security is enforced at multiple layers (input validation, sandboxing, rate limiting)
- Authentication is managed via environment variables and configuration files
- Error handling includes graceful fallbacks when agents are unavailable
